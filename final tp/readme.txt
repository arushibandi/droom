DROOM! README
External Modules/Libraries:
-numpy should be installed: in terminal, run: pip3 install numpy
-PIL should be installed: in terminal, run: pip3 install pillow
-requests should be installed: in terminal, run: pip3 install requests
-BeautifulSoup4 should be installed: in terminal, run: pip3 install beautifulsoup4
-OpenCV is required, and the folders build/ and opencv-3.3.1/ should be in the parent directory of the src/ folder. (I sent these folders in an email to my tp mentor, but as long as opencv2 is installed it should work)

To run:
in terminal, run: python3 /path/to/final\ tp/src/main_final.py

To use the program:
First, take a picture (or get one from the internet) of a moderately-completely empty room. A test image is included in this file for you to use as well.
Save this picture in an easy to access location on your computer. This will be the room you are decorating. Open DROOM! You will see a brief description on the left, and a user preferences tab on the right. You can fill out these style/budget preferences either before or after you upload your room. Throughout the process of decorating your room, little pop-up messages will appear to tell you what the program is doing, and what you should do next. When you click the button to save your room, the txt file will be saved in the src/ folder. Have fun!!!!

Peace
Arushi
